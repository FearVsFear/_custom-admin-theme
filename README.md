# _custom-admin-theme
A custom Wordpress admin theme with configurable styles. A very light but clean, once and for all Wordpress theme. This admin theme also offers consistency coloring for other plugins to try and give a same color style experience across other plugins. (I personally hate the multiple editing experiences across Wordpress. I believe strongly there should be more consistency here. This is to try and help meet this ideal., but ideally Wordpress needs an ideal UI so devs can be satisfied with a more savvy and robust admin UX.)
